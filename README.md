# GKG Cryptography 🔐

Welcome to my personal cryptography learning archive. This repository serves as the central hub for the code, scripts, and mathematical solvers I develop while studying modern cryptography and solving challenges (primarily from [CryptoHack](https://cryptohack.org/)).

## 📂 Repository Structure

While this GitHub repository hosts the **raw code and solution scripts**, the deep dive into the logic and mathematics behind them is documented elsewhere.

- **GitHub:** Stores the implementation, Python scripts, and solvers.
- **Notion:** Stores the **thought process**, mathematical proofs, and detailed write-ups of *how* and *why* the solution works.

## 🧠 Read the Write-ups

I believe that understanding the underlying logic is more important than just getting the flag. You can read my detailed documentation, thought processes, and study notes here:

## 🚀 Objectives

I created this documentation for two main reasons:

1.  **Knowledge Base:** To create a refined learning resource that can eventually help others understand cryptographic concepts, transitioning from raw notes to a structured guide.
2.  **Progress Tracking:** To transparently document my journey and consistency in learning Cybersecurity and Cryptography.
